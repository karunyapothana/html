    <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on <b>8 June 1955,</b> the son of mathematicians and<b> computer scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924–2017)</b> and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019).<br> His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. His paternal grandmother was a Canadian woman from Winnipeg.[25] He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management.<br> Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended the Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics.While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.</p>

    <p>In <b>June 2009,</b> then-British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would work with the UK government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force.<br> Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk, a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free reuse. <br>Commenting on the opening up of Ordnance Survey data in<b> April 2010, Berners-Lee said:</b> "The changes signal a wider cultural change in government<br> based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around." <br>He went on to say: "Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater <br>choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.</p>
